====================

XFCE Extensible System Info Plugin


xfce4-sysinfo-plugin is a plugin for displaying system information in the
xfce panel. It can display any data as a graph, as long as there is a plugin
that can provide that data. Data could include CPU utilisation, memory
usage and network traffic.

IMPORTANT - 2014-08-04: The plugin works for displaying CPU usage, memory 
usage and network traffic. The colours, order and whether a plugin is enabled 
can be changed. The configuration is currently not saved, and so will be lost
on logout.

Known bugs: Changing the order of plugins loses the right click menu. If anyone
knows how to fix it, please contact me.
