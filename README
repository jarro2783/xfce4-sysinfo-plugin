====================

XFCE Extensible System Info Plugin


IMPORTANT - 23/12/2013: This is a work in progress. It is currently in 
development, and is probably not either working or reliable.

xfce4-sysinfo-plugin is a plugin for displaying system information in the
xfce panel. It can display any data as a graph, as long as there is a plugin
that can provide that data. Data could include CPU utilisation, memory
usage and network traffic.
